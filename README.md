## How to Play

- **Objective**: Capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them from making any moves.
- **Movement**: Pieces move diagonally across the board. Jump over your opponent's pieces to capture them.
- **Promotion**: Pieces reaching the opposite side are promoted to "kings," which can move both forward and backward.
- **Winning**: The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or leaves them without legal moves.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The programming language used for the game logic.
- **Pygame**: Used for rendering the game window and handling input/output.
